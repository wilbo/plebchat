### Plebchat

This app is like a simple version of WhatsApp. Provide a username and start chatting. A room system is still to be implemented to make your conversations a bit more private. You might come across some strangers now.

Made with: [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [express](http://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/).<br>
Project: [plebchat.wilbo.io](http://plebchat.wilbo.io). <br>

    $ git clone https://github.com/wilbo/duodoodle.git
    $ cd duodoodle
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
